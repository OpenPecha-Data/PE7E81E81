Brief Succession of Lives Prayer
by Khenpo Ngawang Palzang

chitar lobpön jampal shenyen dang
Outwardly, you are the ācārya Mañjuśrīmitra,
nangtar rigdzin chenpo hung kara
Inwardly, the vidyādhara Hūṃkara,
sangwa penchen bimamitré shyab
Secretly, the noble mahāpaṇḍita Vimalamitra,
yangsang chö kyi gyalpo longchenpa
And most secretly, the Dharmarāja Longchenpa—
dorjé ziji tsal la solwa deb
Dorje Zijitsal, to you I pray!

sherab chenpö chö kyi denyi zik
With great wisdom, you saw the nature of phenomena,
nyingjé chenpö dro nam jesu dzin
And with great compassion, you care for living beings,
palden lamé jezung khyentsé ter
Guided by your glorious guru, you are a treasure of wisdom and love—
ngak gi wangpö shyab la solwa deb
Ngakgi Wangpo, at your feet I pray!

di dang chima bardo tamché du
Throughout this life, in future lives, and in the bardo state,
dralmé tsewé jezung mindrol gyi
Guide me affectionately without ever parting, and grant your blessings
sang chen dütsi tob né dro kün gyi
So that I may receive the great secret nectar of ripening empowerments and liberating instructions,
taktu pendé drubpar jingyi lob
And thereafter bring everlasting benefit and happiness to all beings!

Thus, the idle one whom Terchen Rinpoche1 called Jampal Gyepa Zilnön Ngakgi Wangpo or Dorje
Zijitsal wrote down whatever came to mind.
