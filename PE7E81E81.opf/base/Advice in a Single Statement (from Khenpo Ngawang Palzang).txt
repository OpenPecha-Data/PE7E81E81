Advice in a Single Statement (from Khenpo Ngawang Palzang)

As recorded by Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche

Homage to the lama!

"Here in Dzogpachenpo, we settle, without contriving, in what we call the essence (or the face)
of mind: in other words, its basic condition, left simply as it is, its own inherent nature.


Then, it is said, “While undistracted, let the mind look into itself.” Simply turning within
lays bare our own naturally abiding capacity to know, our ‘ordinary awareness’ (tamal gyi
shepa), and causes it to dawn.

Then, at all times, whether eating, sleeping, moving or staying still, if we can sustain this,
with mindfulness and without forgetting, then, like an old man watching a child at play,
having recognised the dharmakāya, which is the source of liberation, we will be able to
take the thoughts that are its expression onto the path, and they will be liberated upon arising,
without leaving any trace behind.

This advice in a single statement was taught by the great Khenpo Ngawang Palzang."
