The Five Wisdoms According to Khenpo Ngakchung

by Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche

According to the oral tradition of Khenchen Ngaga:

The realisation of the natural state of all phenomena & the true nature (or ‘as-it-isness’)
of the mind, which is the absolute sphere of reality, is the wisdom of dharmadhātu.

The unobstructed clarity of rigpa’s naturally arising radiance is the mirror-like wisdom.

The realisation that all phenomena have always been of ‘equal taste’ within great rigpa-awareness
is the wisdom of equality.

The understanding of all relative phenomena, the things themselves (as opposed to their nature),
without confusing or mixing them up, by means of the intelligence that is part of rigpa’s
expressive power (tsal), is the wisdom of discernment.

That these are all realised without any of the effort or exertion of the ordinary mind, but
as a great, spontaneous accomplishment, is the all-accomplishing wisdom.
